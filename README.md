# EN: Python for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)

These are my notes and exercises from the course ["Python for Everybody", by Dr. Charles R. Severance, at Michigan University](https://online.umich.edu/courses/programming-for-everybody-getting-started-with-python/). The book used here is "Python for Everybody" also by Dr. Charles R. Severance and is available online.

I care a lot about this course, probably because it was the second one I took on Python... ever. Mr. Charles R. Severance has deep knowledge on Python and enough charisma to grab your attention. 

First course I ever took on Python was the one I had at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brazil, as an undergrad Information Systems student back in 2019. What a ride.

May these notes and exercises be of any use to you.

Cheers,

B.
